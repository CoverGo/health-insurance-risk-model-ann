The present study proposes the use of artificial neural networks for risk assessment in the health insurance industry. A two-stage decision support model was devised using a Kohonen self-organizing map and aplying PCA to reduce the dimension of our dataset. as second stage we applied a multilayer feed-forward network in order to make the risk assessment process more effective.
