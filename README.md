The present study proposes the use of artificial neural networks for risk assessment in the health insurance industry. A two-stage decision support model was devised using a Kohonen self-organizing map and applying PCA to reduce the dimension of our dataset. As second stage we applied a multilayer feed-forward network in order to make the risk assessment process more effective and accurate.

ANN model seem to be outperforming traditional statistical approaches on predicting of peopleâ€™s health condition,especially when trained with a huge various data
